This website tries to address the needs of the customer to find all the information that they needed to contact the restaurant, while breaking the information simple and easy to follow as possible.
The business goals of this website are:

*	Make the restaurant more popular in Ireland.
*	Easy Reservation for a dine out.
*	Awareness about the available catering services.
	 

The customer goals of this website are:

*	Searching for an Indian Restaurant for a dine out.
*	Easily available menu and pricing.
*	Easy reservation and catering bookings.
*	Easy to find location.

## UX

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design.
*For customers,* I wanted to provide them with a brief overview about the restaurant and the services available in a user friendly design. 

*The ideal client* for this business is the restaurant management who can communicate well about what they need in their website. 

*People* use this website to search for the nearby Indian restaurant,glutein free and vegan friendly for a dine out or any party catering services.

This project is one of the best way to achieve the goals because many restaurant websites have poor UX, some of them doestnâ€™t offer online reservation and online menu and pricing.
This website is with minimalist design ,easy to navigate ,and provides all the necessary information without complicating them.
